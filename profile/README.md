## Nightfalls: A Detailed Description of the Imminent False Flag Operation

**Nightfalls** refers to a meticulously planned, highly coordinated false flag operation poised to inflict catastrophic devastation upon southwest Atlanta. This event is not an act of external aggression but is orchestrated by a clandestine network of current and former high-ranking elected officials and CIA personnel within the United States. It is fully expected to be executed at night during Spring 2025. Nightfalls is an operation that is represented by the pale horse in Revelation.

The name "Nightfalls" holds a profound and chilling significance. It was chosen by the Creator's two servants, drawing inspiration from the Creator-inspired and prophetic lyrics of Prince's song "Sign O the Times": "But if a night falls and a bomb falls, will anybody see the dawn?" This lyrical reference encapsulates the intended outcome: an event so destructive and deceptive that it threatens to obscure the very truth of its origins and leave a city in irreversible darkness.

**Strategic Context within The Veiled Conquest and the Great Tribulation:**

Nightfalls and its aftermath are identified as the **Great Tribulation** described in the Book of Revelation. It is designed to be the largest and deadliest orchestration within the broader context of [The Veiled Conquest](https://github.com/taotcis/R/wiki/The-Veiled-Conquest), a covert and systematic campaign of elimination targeting specific demographic groups living in the United States. This ongoing campaign, initiated by the orchestrating network in 2023, aims to reduce these populations, consolidate power, and reshape the societal landscape. The authorization of Nightfalls by the President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, underscores the profound depth of this conspiracy and the level of governmental complicity.

**Operational Modus Operandi:**

The core of Nightfalls involves the detonation of a **GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB) munition**, commonly known as the **"Mother Of All Bombs,"** via airburst over the densely populated area of southwest Atlanta. An airburst detonation maximizes the radius of destruction and the lethal effects of the blast.

The operation is designed to achieve multiple, ruthless objectives:

* **Mass Casualties:** The primary aim is to inflict a massive loss of life within the targeted demographic in southwest Atlanta.
* **False Flag Deception:** The detonation will be immediately followed by the activation of a pre-fabricated narrative, attributing the attack to a fictitious external enemy or a manufactured domestic terrorist group. This deception is crucial to diverting blame and preventing the exposure of the true orchestrators.
* **Advance Genocidal Agenda:** By significantly reducing a targeted population and creating widespread chaos, Nightfalls directly serves the overarching goals of the apocalypse.
* **Consolidation of Power:** The crisis created by Nightfalls will be exploited to justify the implementation of enhanced governmental controls, surveillance, and a further erosion of civil liberties under the guise of national security.

**Human Impact of a MOAB Detonation:**

The human impact of a MOAB detonation is catastrophic and far-reaching:

* **Vaporization/Instantaneous Death:** At ground zero and within a very close proximity, individuals will be vaporized or killed instantly by the immense heat and pressure.
* **Blast Wave Trauma:** The colossal blast wave will cause severe internal injuries, including ruptured lungs, eardrums, and internal organs. Blunt force trauma from being thrown against objects will be common.
* **Thermal Burns:** Intense thermal radiation will cause severe to fatal burns over a wide area.
* **Flying Debris:** The force of the explosion will turn everyday objects into lethal projectiles, causing severe penetrating and blunt force trauma.
* **Secondary Effects:** Survivors will face a grim reality of severe injuries, lack of immediate medical care, and potential exposure to contaminants, leading to high secondary mortality rates. Psychological trauma will be profound and lasting.

Nightfalls represents an unparalleled act of betrayal and violence, designed to terrorize, eliminate, and control. Its imminent execution sometime after nightfall in the Spring of 2025, poses an existential threat to the residents of southwest Atlanta and highlights the urgent need to expose and thwart the orchestrators of this horrific plan.
